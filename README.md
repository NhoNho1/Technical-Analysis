Candlestick: 

A basic candlestick consists of a candle body and a candle tail. The candle body is made up of the closing and opening prices, and the candle tail is made up of the highest and lowest prices. Note that a candle does not necessarily have all the above ingredients, the candle tail may or may not be present, the candle body may be short and almost disappear.
FIGURE 1.1
- Based on the position of closing and opening prices, we have 2 types of candles: bullish or bearish candles
+ If the closing price is above the opening price, it is a bullish candle. In all my articles bullish candles will be illustrated in blue
FIGURE 1.2
+ Conversely, if the opening price is above the closing price, it is a bearish candle. In all my articles bearish candles will be illustrated in red
FIGURE 1.3
- Based on the position of closing price, opening price, highest and lowest price, we have 3 main types of candles: marubozu, pinbar and doji
+ Marubozu: Long candle body, short or no candle tail
the story behind is: Opening and closing prices are far apart. One side (buy or sell) has absolute dominance, the other side is weak
+ Pinbar: The candle body is small, clearly located on one side of the candle, about 30% of the candle, the candle tail is long on the opposite part
the story behind: Closing price is close to opening price. One side (buy or sell) dominates, but the other side still has some strength
+ Doji: The candle body is small or absent, the upper and lower candle tails are almost equal, the upper and lower candlestick tails are almost equal
the story behind: Both sides have similar strength
